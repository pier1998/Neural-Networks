# Neural-Networks
exercises and project for the neural networks course.

The course focused on the study of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN).

## Exercises
The exercises were meant to provide a general understanding of ANN and SNN.

## Project
The SNN project is a 1D retina sandbox that develop an advanced vision system for (1D) motion classification, which is not limited to one specific pattern.
